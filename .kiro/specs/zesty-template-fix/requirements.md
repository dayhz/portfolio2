# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current ZestyTemplateRenderer component uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML with raw HTML, which causes rendering issues because external CSS and JavaScript files are not properly loaded in the React context. This results in broken styling where text overlaps images and the layout is inconsistent. We need to create a proper React component that reproduces the Zesty template structure with integrated CSS styles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing a project with the Zesty template, I want the template to render correctly with proper styling and layout, so that the content is readable and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ZestyTemplateRenderer component is rendered THEN the layout SHALL match the original zesty.html appearance
2. WHEN text content is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT overlap with images or other elements
3. WHEN the component loads THEN all CSS styles SHALL be properly applied without external dependencies
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the template SHALL be responsive and maintain proper layout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the CMS, I want the Zesty template to be implemented as a proper React component, so that it's maintainable and integrates well with the React ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the template THEN it SHALL use React JSX instead of dangerouslySetInnerHTML
2. WHEN styles are applied THEN they SHALL be embedded within the component or imported as CSS modules
3. WHEN the component receives project data THEN it SHALL dynamically populate all content areas
4. WHEN the component is updated THEN it SHALL not break existing functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want all dynamic content areas to be properly populated with project data, so that each project displays its unique information correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project data is provided THEN the hero section SHALL display the correct title and image
2. WHEN project information is shown THEN client, year, duration, type, industry, and scope SHALL be displayed correctly
3. WHEN challenge and approach sections are rendered THEN they SHALL show the project-specific content or fallback to default text
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use project-specific URLs or fallback to default Zesty images
5. WHEN videos are included THEN they SHALL load and play correctly with proper poster images

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the template to include all the visual elements from the original design, so that the presentation maintains the same professional quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation is displayed THEN it SHALL include the logo, menu items, and mobile menu functionality
2. WHEN sections are rendered THEN proper spacing and layout SHALL be maintained between elements
3. WHEN images are shown THEN they SHALL have the correct border radius and aspect ratios
4. WHEN the testimonial section is displayed THEN it SHALL include quote, author image, name, and role
5. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN hover states and animations SHALL work correctly
